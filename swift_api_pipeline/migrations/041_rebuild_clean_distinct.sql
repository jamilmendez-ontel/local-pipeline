-- Migration 041: Add DISTINCT ON to rebuild_timer_clean() to collapse true duplicates
--
-- True duplicates (100% identical entries except id) exist in staging due to
-- API re-ingestion. The clean table should only contain one copy per unique
-- natural key combination. DISTINCT ON collapses these, keeping the row with
-- the lowest id.
